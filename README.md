### SUMMARY
From the results, it shows that there's indeed a "silver tsunami" of the number of retiring employees to the employees eligible to be mentored.
- The number of retiring roles are *90,398* but the employees eligible for mentoring are *1,559*, *88,849* shortfalls which is about 1.7% of eligible employees to the retring ones.
- There are *2 managers* and *4,502 technique leaders* among the retiring employees who are qualified to mentor the incoming roles, but they are few compared to the shortfall roles. Not enough to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
